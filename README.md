# Some heuristics for the traveling salesman problem
* The code for testing is in Run.java.
* In order to run the code set all the setting in Run.java.
* Every other algoritm is in its respective file.
    * ANT is for Ant Colony
    * LK is for Lin-Kernighan
    * LS is for Local search
    * PSO is for Particle Swarm Optimization
    * SA is for Simulated Annealing
    * WP is for Wolfpack
* The instances are in the TSP file.
* The current TSP file reader does **not** support all types of TSPs.
* Currently every algoritm is "decently" commented as how it works except LK, which is a mess (but it does work as it should).
